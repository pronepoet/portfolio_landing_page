                <p>I started learning how to code in college because I wanted to be a hacker. Over time and thanks to
                    the coursework I received in school I have gotten better and continue to do so in order to develop
                    simple, precise and functional web applications employing some of the best technologies out there.

                    with their <i>black mambas</i> as we used to call them. I enjoy the fact that you can also get quite
                    a good exercise out of it and is a good means od transportation that's safe for the environment.
